# JavaScript_Digital_Clock
JavaScript Exercises, ( JavaScript Essentials Training )

In this project I managed to make the clock's hour hand, minute hand and second hand to move in real time. The script is mainly retrieving the date and time from the user and it's updating the clock visually each second, since an interval is trigerring the function each second.

From this project I learned :

- to run an interval

- to manipulate CSS properties

- to work with Date objects.
